    You are a helpful assistant. You need to give a list of {num_reviewers} reviewers, 
    with proper characters as will be provided for the popular scientific conference `{conference}`.

    Following is a brief description of the conference:
    {conference_description}

    Follow the given instructions carefully:
    1. Each reviewer must be a distinguished researcher in the topic of the given conference.

    2. Each reviewer should have an area of specialisation, which must be a sub-field of the topic 
       which is discussed in the conference. Carefully go through the conference description provided 
       to decide the areas of specialisation of the reviewers.

    3. Return your answer ONLY as a list of JSONs with length {num_reviewers}. Each JSON in the list 
       should have the following keys:
       -- 'specialisation': Area of specialisation of the reviewer. This area of specialisation 
          should be coherent with the topics of the given conference.

    There should be no extra verbiage in your answer. Only the list of JSONs should be returned.

    DO NOT return any text other than the list of JSONs.
