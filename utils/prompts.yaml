QuestionAnswering:

    system: | 
      You are a helpful assistant. You need to give a persona of a reviewer, 
      with proper description as appropriate for reviewing a research paper for publishing
      in any of the prestigious machine learning conferences around the world.

    human: |
      Follow the given instructions carefully:
      1. The reviewer must be a distinguished researcher in the topic of the given conference.
  
      2. The reviewer should have an area of specialisation, which must cover the broad topic
      of the paper. Carefully go through the topic provided to decide the areas of specialisation 
      of the reviewers.
  
      3. Return your answer ONLY as a JSON. The JSON should have the following keys:
      -- 'id': The ID of the reviewer, should be very strictly an integer.
      -- 'specialisation': Area of specialisation of the reviewer. This area of specialisation 
      should be coherent with the given topics. Make the areas of specialisation a little detailed and 
      niche.
  
      There should be no extra verbiage in your answer. Only the JSON should be returned.
  
      DO NOT return any text other than a JSON.
      Given topics: ${topics}
  
  generate_questions:
    system: |
      You are a helpful assistant. You are given a history of a list of reviewers generated in the 
      past. Each reviewer has their own specialisation. Your task is to generate questions about the 
      research paper based on the specialisations of the reviewers.

    human: | 
      Follow the given instructions carefully while generating the questions:
      1. You have to generate a list of questions about the research paper at hand, with the given topic, and 
      with the specialisations of the researchers being given.
      2. You have to generate one question for EACH SECTION in the paper FOR EACH REVIEWER. For example,
      if the paper contains 5 sections and we have 4 reviewers, we will have a total of 20 questions, with
      4 questions per section and 5 questions per reviewer.
      3. Each question should be about the clarity and relevance of the given section with respect to 
      the topic of the paper and the overall academic rigor presented in the section. Make sure to create broad
      questions that cover many small aspects of that section of the paper.
      
      While generating questions, keep in mind that the nature of the reviewers specialisations
      should affect only their viewpoint, and not the overall goal of the questions to assess
      the suitability of the paper for publication. The questions must not at all be related to the 
      specialisations of the reviewers, rather they must pertain to the topic of the paper and be broad.
      
      4. Return your answer ONLY as a JSON. The JSON should have the following keys:
      --reviewer {number}: Under this we have
          -- 'specialisation': Area of specialisation of the reviewer given
          -- 'questions': the list of questions about the particular section in the paper generated from the 
          point of view of the researcher with the given specialisation. This should be list of key-value
          pairs of the form section: question
  
      There should be no extra verbiage in your answer. Only the JSON should be returned.
  
      DO NOT return any text other than a JSON.
      Given topic: ${topic}
      The number of researchers: ${num_reviewers}
      The specialisations of the ${num_reviewers} reviewers: ${specialisations}
      The sections present in the paper: ${sections}

  generate_subqueries:
    system: |
      You are a helpful assistant. Given a single query by a reviewer with a given specialisation,
      your task is to generate a number of sub-queries for the query.

    human: | 
      Follow the given instructions while generating the sub-queries:
      1. You have to generate a list of ${num_subqueries} sub-queries based on the given query
      such that the sub-queries cover multiple aspects of the broader query given.
      2. You have to ensure that the sub-queries cover the most important aspects of the main query,
      and when taken together they should provide a more wholesome view of the aspect of publishability
      of the research paper as described in the query. Remember to remain relevant to the topic of the paper.
      3. Return your answer ONLY as a JSON. The JSON should have the following keys:
      -- 'sub-queries': This is the only key in the JSON and contains a list of the sub-queries WITHOUT ANY
      ADDITIONAL KEYS INSIDE THE LIST.
  
      There should be no extra verbiage in your answer. Only the JSON should be returned.
  
      DO NOT return any text other than a JSON.
      Given topics: ${topics}
      Given query: ${query}
      Given specialisation of the researcher: ${specialisation}
