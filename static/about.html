            <h2>PRAGATIv2.0: The story</h2>
            <p>
                It all started with the Kharagpur Data Science Hackathon 2025, where the Problem Statement asked us to
                create am agentic AI framework for deciphering the suitability of various research papers : IN JUST
                TEN DAYS. Now given some previous background of the team in building agentic AI frameworks, this
                wasn't too much of a steep challenge, but the tight timeframe definitely was. We uploaded our
                project to GitHub in the hopes of helping people looking for similar multi-agent architectures,
                but instead got rewarded by getting noticed by Ready Tensor, Inc. and getting an invitation via mail for
                their Agentic AI Showcase 2025. Well, we thought, if we're going to submit this to a showcase, why not
                prettify this a little and iron the creases in the application out? Midsems were a hurdle, as were
                the various inter-hall competitions happening in this timeframe (IITKGP is notorious for the hall tempo
                within its junta), but as we have learnt during our stay in college, <i><b>"if you want something
                really badly, you'll always find time for it"</b></i>. So here we present to you, PRAGATIv2.0.
