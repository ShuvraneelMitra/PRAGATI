# Publishability of Research Papers: An Agentic AI Automation Approach

## Introduction and Background of the problem statement
In academic and research settings, the evaluation of research papers is crucial for advancing knowledge and innovation. However, the traditional process of manually assessing papers for publication and conference suitability is labor-intensive, subjective, and time-consuming. As the volume of research output continues to grow, there is an urgent need for AI-driven systems that can automate these processes while maintaining consistency and accuracy.

The first task focuses on determining whether a research paper meets the standards for publication. This evaluation process involves analyzing the content for critical issues, such as:
- Inappropriate methodologies.
- Logical incoherence in arguments.
- Lack of evidence or validation for claims.

The second task extends the system’s capabilities by recommending the most suitable academic conferences for research papers classified as "Publishable." The framework must:
- Analyze the paper's subject matter, methodology, and findings.
- Compare the content against benchmark reference papers from top-tier conferences such as CVPR, NeurIPS, EMNLP, TMLR, and KDD.
- Justify the selection with a rationale outlining the alignment between the paper’s content and the conference’s focus areas.

## Salient Features of our solution
PRAGATI stands out as a transformative AI application designed to elevate the research evaluation process. Unlike conventional fact-checkers or static AI-based reviewers, PRAGATI employs a uniquely dynamic and intelligent approach to assessment. By generating context-aware questions, it "interviews" each research paper, meticulously analyzing its arguments, methodologies, and contributions. This innovative technique enables PRAGATI to perform two critical functions with unparalleled precision:

### Fact-Checking Excellence:
PRAGATI operates as a rigorous AI-driven fact-checker, capable of verifying claims, methodologies, and data against established benchmarks. This ensures that every submission adheres to the highest academic standards, reducing the risk of publishing flawed or unsubstantiated research.
### Tailored Conference Recommendations:
Beyond determining a paper’s publishability, PRAGATI excels in identifying the most suitable top-tier conferences for submission. By cross-referencing the paper’s content, focus, and findings with profiles of renowned conferences, PRAGATI provides tailored recommendations. Its ability to align research contributions with the unique scope and standards of prestigious venues such as CVPR, NeurIPS, and EMNLP ensures that papers are matched with the most relevant academic platforms.
